## Overview

**Trap Runner** is a Game Boy Advance game created using the BP Core Engine. It was one of my first coding projects, developed in 2022. The gameplay is simple, yet addictive, inspired by classic games like *Copter*.  

In **Trap Runner**, you control a character that continuously moves forward. Your goal is to navigate up and down to avoid enemies and walls while trying to survive as long as possible. The game features a timer that measures how far you can go. If you crash into an obstacle or enemy, the timer resets, challenging you to beat your previous record.

## Development Process

Creating **Trap Runner** was an early project that taught me a lot about game development for the GBA. Here's a summary of the process:

1. **Choosing the Engine:**  
   I selected the BP Core Engine for its simplicity and GBA compatibility, which allowed me to focus on gameplay mechanics rather than low-level hardware concerns.  

2. **Designing the Gameplay:**  
   Inspired by *Copter*, I wanted a simple, yet addictive gameplay loop: move, avoid, survive, and repeat. I implemented a timer system to track progress and reset upon crashes.  

3. **Implementing Obstacles and Enemies:**  
   I coded enemy patterns and wall collisions to provide increasing challenges as the player progresses.  

4. **Polishing and Testing:**  
   I spent time balancing the game's difficulty, adjusting the speed and spacing of obstacles to make it fair but challenging.  

5. **Final Touches:**  
   I added a basic UI to display the timer and reset the game upon crashing, creating a complete experience ready to play on the GBA or an emulator.
